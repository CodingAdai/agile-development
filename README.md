# 敏捷开发

## Agile development isn't just about developers
## 敏捷开发不仅仅是开发者
> Nobody wants to ship software with lots of bugs, performance issues, and low customer satisfaction. Continuous integration and code reviews help prevent this... but who has the time, right? Well, agile teams make time.

没有人希望交付有很多bug，性能问题，客户满意度很低的软件。持续集成和代码审查可以避免这类事情的发生。但是谁有这个事情去做持续集成和代码审查的事情呢？ 敏捷团队腾出时间。
> Agile developers focus on sustainable development–not heroics. Sustainability is about good estimation, effective branching strategies for managing code, automated testing to protect quality, and continuous deployment to get fast feedback from users. Adopting sustainable development practices requires a discipline most of us aspire to–but often struggle to realize–as individuals. That's because nobody can go agile in a vacuum. The culture of the entire organization has to rally behind it. That means getting project leaders to buy into the notion that quality is more important than scope or schedule, which is often the hardest part of adopting agile.

敏捷开发人员专注于可持续开发 - 而不是英雄。 可持续开发是一个很好的预算，有效的代码分支管理代码策略，自动化测试以保护质量，并持续部署以获得用户的快速反馈。 采用可持续开发实践需要一个纪律，我们大多数人渴望 - 但往往努力实现 - 作为个人。 那是因为没有人可以在团队中去敏捷。 整个组织的文化必须团结。 这意味着让项目负责人需要更加重视质量而不是范围或进度，这通常是采用敏捷的最难的部分。
> But it's worth it! Developers get the freedom and accountability to develop software sustainably, while still maintaining a great relationship with the business. And the business gets to take a higher-quality product to market, which further reinforces that great relationship with engineering. What's more (and here's the best part), agile developers rarely face "death marches." When development falls behind schedule because maintaining high quality takes more effort than anticipated, the scope side of the iron triangle can flex to accommodate that reality–and nobody's weekend gets hijacked.

但这是值得的！ 开发人员获得可持续发展软件的自由和责任感，同时与业务保持着良好的关系。 业务可以将更高质量的产品推向市场，进一步加强与工程的良好关系。 更多（这里是最好的部分），敏捷开发者很少面对“死亡游行”。 当开发落后于时间表，因为保持高质量需要比预期更多的努力，铁三角的规模可以弯曲以适应这一现实 - 没有人的周末被劫持。
> All software developers know the "iron triangle" of project management: scope, schedule, and quality. And most of us have been on projects where the scope was inflexible, the schedule got mangled, and development was overwhelmed by mounting technical debt. Sometimes–just to add insult to injury–the end product wasn't even what the market wanted. That's a frustrating, and tragically familiar, place to be.

所有软件开发人员都知道项目管理的“铁三角”：规模，进度和质量。 而且我们大多数人都是在这个项目上变得不灵活，时间安排得到了改善，而且由于技术债务的增加，发展也不堪重负。 有时候 - 只是为了增加侮辱伤害 - 最终产品甚至不是市场所需要的。 这是一个令人沮丧和悲惨的熟悉的地方。
> But fear not: there is good news.

但不要害怕，有好消息。
>With agile development, scope becomes the dynamic variable so teams can protect quality, build a vibrant development culture, and stay tightly coupled with the business. At Atlassian, agile is at the core of every development team (as well as many non-dev teams!). And for good reason.

随着敏捷开发，规模成为动态变量，所以团队可以保护质量，建立一个充满活力的发展文化，并与业务紧密结合。 在Atlassian，敏捷是每个开发团队的核心（以及许多非开发团队！）。 有很好的理由。

> Agile isn't just a set of ceremonies. It's a cultural and technical philosophy.

敏捷不仅仅是一套仪式。这是一个文化和技术哲学。
> It empowers individuals with practices that build a solid technical foundation into their product and a culture of collaboration into their team. Developers on agile teams are more engaged, write better code, and have more fun. 

它赋予个人以实践的方式，在他们的产品中建立坚实的技术基础，并将合作文化融入其团队。 敏捷团队的开发者更多地参与，编写更好的代码，并且更有趣。

## 强连接意味着更强的产品

> Agile is about teamwork, which is no surprise since most software today is built by teams. Developers build strong relationships with product management, design, QA, and operations because writing sustainable code means staying connected to all facets of the project. Atlassian has seen huge benefits in code quality and developer satisfaction by empowering developers to work directly with other parts of the business. Better code, less "thrash" (i.e. duplication of effort and/or conflicting streams of work), and more effective cross-functionalism are just a few of the benefits.

敏捷是关于团队合作，这并不奇怪，因为大多数软件今天是由团队建立的。 开发人员与产品管理，设计，质检和运营建立牢固的关系，因为编写可持续性代码意味着与项目的所有方面保持联系。 Atlassian通过授权开发人员直接与其他业务部门合作，在代码质量和开发人员满意度方面获得了巨大的收益。 更好的代码，更少的“thrash”（即重复的努力和/或冲突的工作流）和更有效的跨功能主义只是一些好处。

> Mentoring is big, too. Agile teams cross-train each other to ensure knowledge of the code base is spread throughout the team. One way this is done is through code reviews, which not only protect quality, but cross-pollinate familiarity with the code across the team. Regardless of how the knowledge spreads, agile teams don't end up with critical-path developers who can't go on vacation because they're the only ones who understand a particular area of code. Because nobody wants to be that developer.]

指导也很大。 敏捷团队互相交叉，以确保代码库的知识遍及整个团队。 这样做的一个方法是通过代码审查，不仅可以保护质量，而且可以跨团体熟悉整个团队的代码。 不管知识传播如何，敏捷团队不会因为理解特定代码领域的唯一人员而导致无法继续休假的关键路径开发人员。 因为没有人想成为那个开发者。

> Agile developers can also work up and down their product's technology stack with greater ease than their waterfall counterparts because agile teams self-organize, giving members chances to pick up new skills. It's a fact that developers who deliver entire features–from UI to DB– take greater ownership of their code. At Atlassian, we cultivate full-stack developers because we believe in sharing knowledge across the team, and throughout the company.

敏捷开发人员还可以比瀑布对手更轻松地对付他们产品的技术堆栈，因为敏捷团队自行组织，使成员有机会获得新技能。 事实上，提供整个功能的开发人员（从UI到DB）拥有更多的代码所有权。 在Atlassian，我们培养全栈开发人员，因为我们相信在整个团队和整个公司分享知识。
